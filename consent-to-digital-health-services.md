##Binding arbitration 

A note on binding arbitration

Pharmr enables patients to self-direct their chronic care in association with a medical practice. In order to facilitate higher levels of risk associated with this mode of care, Practices on Pharmr require you to agree to binding arbitration for dispute resolution. 

By agreeing to this Agreement, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you, your  heirs, relatives, or other associated parties may have against the Practice, including any claim for medical malpractice (a claim that medical services were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly, negligently, or incompetently rendered), for premises liability, or relating to the coverage for, or delivery of, services or items, irrespective of legal theory, on an individual basis in arbitration as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. This will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against the Practice, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against the Practice by someone else. For the avoidance of doubt, this precludes you from bringing or participating in any kind of any class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, representative or other kind of group, multi-plaintiff or joint action against the Practice. 

**(a) Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and the Practice.**
Except as expressly provided below in Section 2(b), you and the Practice agree that any dispute, claim or controversy in any way arising out of or relating to (i) these Terms and prior versions of these Terms, or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, scope, waiver, or validity thereof, (ii) your access to or use of the Services at any time, (iii) incidents or accidents resulting in personal injury that you allege occurred in connection with your use of the Services, whether the dispute, claim or controversy occurred or accrued before or after the date you agreed to the Terms, or (iv) your relationship with the Practice, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and the Practice, and not in a court of law. This Agreement survives after your relationship with the Practice ends.

You acknowledge and agree that you and the Practice are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to bring or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any class, purported class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, or representative proceeding.
This Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall include any claims brought by or against any third-parties, including but not limited to your spouses, heirs, third-party beneficiaries and assigns, where their underlying claims are in relation to your use of the Services. To the extent that any third-party beneficiary to this agreement brings claims against the Parties; those claims shall also be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.

**(b) Exceptions to Arbitration**
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; (ii) individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment occurring in connection with your use of the Services; and/or (iii) injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.

Such claims may be brought and litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction by you on an individual basis only. On an individual basis means that you cannot bring such claims as a class, coordinated, consolidated, collective, or representative action against the Practice. For the avoidance of doubt, this precludes you from bringing claims as or participating in any kind of any class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, representative or other kind of group, multi-plaintiff or joint action against the Practice and no action brought by you may be consolidated or joined in any fashion with any other proceeding. Where your claims are brought and litigated to completion on such an individual basis in a court of competent jurisdiction, the Practice agrees to honor your election.
The parties’ agreement not to require arbitration in these limited instances does not waive the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other provision (including, but not limited to, the waivers provided for in Section 2(a), which will continue to apply in court as well as in arbitration), or the enforceability of this Agreement as to any other controversy, claim or dispute.

**(c) Rules and Governing Law.**

The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
The parties agree that the arbitrator ("Arbitrator"), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are applicable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to a dispute, you and the Practice agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.

Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. ("FAA"), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties to be bound by the provisions of the FAA for all purposes, including, but not limited to, interpretation, implementation, enforcement, and administration of this Arbitration Agreement, and that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue regarding the interpretation or enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state where you reside when you accept these Terms.

Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to incidents or accidents resulting in personal injury (including but not limited to sexual assault or harassment claims) that you allege occurred in connection with your use of the Services, whether before or after the date you agreed to the Terms, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state in which the incident or accident occurred.

**(d) Process.**
Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and the Practice each agree to notify the other party in writing of any dispute and to attempt to negotiate an informal resolution. Notice of the dispute must include the party’s name, preferred contact information, a brief description of the dispute, and the relief sought. Notice to the Practice must be sent to the [Practice Technologies, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1515 3rd Street, San Francisco, CA 94158.] Neither party shall initiate arbitration until 30 days after the notice is sent.

(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration Rules at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). A party initiating an arbitration against the Practice must send the written Demand for Arbitration to the Practice Technologies, Inc., LLC, Attn: Legal Department, 1515 3rd Street, San Francisco, CA 94158, or serve the Demand on the Practice’s registered agent for service of process, c/o the Practice Technologies, Inc. (the name and current contact information for the registered agent in each state are available online here). The Arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney licensed to practice law in the state where the arbitration is conducted. The Arbitrator will be selected by the parties from the AAA's National Roster of Arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator after a good faith meet and confer effort, then the AAA will appoint the Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
(e) Location and Procedure.
Unless you and the Practice otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and the Practice submit to the Arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
(f) Arbitrator's Decision.
The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. An Arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties. An Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect. If you prevail in arbitration you may seek an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent permitted under applicable law. the Practice will not seek, and hereby waives all rights the Practice may have under applicable law to recover attorneys' fees and expenses if the Practice prevails in arbitration.
(g) Fees.

(h) Severability and Survival.
If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.
