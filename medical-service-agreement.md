## Medical Service Agreement

This Medical Services Agreement (the “Agreement”) for telemedicine services is by and between {protocol_business_name} (“the Practice”) and You (“you” or “patient”). The Practice agrees to provide you with non-emergent medical services under the specific telehealth program called {protocol_name} through the Platform according to the terms described herein.

By clicking “I agree,” you expressly acknowledge that you have read, understood, and
considered the consequences of this Agreement, that you are at least 18 years of age or older, and that you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and that you are legally competent to enter into this Agreement with the Practice.

### 1.    Introduction

Pharmr enables a new way for you to initiate physician-supported chronic care online. Studies suggest that patients who take an active role in their disease management do better over time. Pharmr enables patients wider leeway in directing their own care vs traditional settings in order to take advantage of this. Consequently, patients may expose themselves to higher levels of risk on the Pharmr platform as a trade off for more control in their medical outcomes. We (i.e. Pharmr) deem self-initiated care a necessary step in this pursuit. Self-initiated care is not without trade offs though. If you are uncomfortable with managing your condition or doing so virtually, or do not feel ready to take a proactive role in the management of your condition, do not agree to the terms contained in this Agreement. Moreover, self-initiated care is not intended to be a replacement for essential medical services but as an adjunctive medical support service. Further, truth in the information you provide and your responses to your provider and the Platform is paramount. Failure to do so could result in harm or death. Please see our Community Guidelines for a complete reference.

### 4. Binding Arbitration

**4.1.    A note on binding arbitration.**

Pharmr enables patients to self-direct their care in association with a medical practice. In order to facilitate higher levels of risk associated with this mode of care, Practices on Pharmr require you to agree to binding arbitration for dispute resolution.
 
**4.2.    Introduction.**

By agreeing to this Agreement, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you, your heirs, relatives, or other associated parties may have against the Practice, including any claim for medical malpractice (a claim that medical services were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly, negligently, or incompetently rendered), for premises liability, or relating to the coverage for, or delivery of, services or items, irrespective of legal theory, on an individual basis in arbitration as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. This will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against the Practice, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against the Practice by someone else. For the avoidance of doubt, this precludes you from bringing or participating in any kind of any class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, representative or other kind of group, multi-plaintiff or joint action against the Practice.

**4.3.    Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and the Practice.**

Except as expressly provided below in Section 2.4, you and the Practice agree that any dispute, claim or controversy in any way arising out of or relating to (i) this Medical Service Agreement and prior versions of this Medical Service Agreement, or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, scope, waiver, or validity thereof, (ii) your access to or use of the Services at any time, (iii) incidents or accidents resulting in personal injury that you allege occurred in connection with your use of the Services, whether the dispute, claim or controversy occurred or accrued before or after the date you agreed to the Terms, or (iv) your relationship with the Practice, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and the Practice, and not in a court of law. This Agreement survives after your relationship with the Practice ends.

You acknowledge and agree that you and the Practice are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to bring or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any class, purported class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, or representative proceeding.

This Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall include any claims brought by or against any third-parties, including but not limited to your spouses, heirs, third-party beneficiaries and assigns, where their underlying claims are in relation to your use of the Services. To the extent that any third-party beneficiary to this agreement brings claims against the Parties; those claims shall also be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.

**4.4.    Exceptions to Arbitration.**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; (ii) individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment occurring in connection with your use of the Services; and/or (iii) injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.

Such claims may be brought and litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction by you on an individual basis only. On an individual basis means that you cannot bring such claims as a class, coordinated, consolidated, collective, or representative action against the Practice. For the avoidance of doubt, this precludes you from bringing claims as or participating in any kind of any class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, representative or other kind of group, multi-plaintiff or joint action against the Practice and no action brought by you may be consolidated or joined in any fashion with any other proceeding. Where your claims are brought and litigated to completion on such an individual basis in a court of competent jurisdiction, the Practice agrees to honor your election.

The parties’ agreement not to require arbitration in these limited instances does not waive the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other provision (including, but not limited to, the waivers provided for in Section 4.3, which will continue to apply in court as well as in arbitration), or the enforceability of this Agreement as to any other controversy, claim or dispute.

**4.5.    Rules and Governing Law.**

("FAA"), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties to be bound by the provisions of the FAA for all purposes, including, but not limited to, interpretation, implementation, enforcement, and administration of this Arbitration Agreement, and that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue regarding the interpretation or enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state where you reside when you accept this Medical Service Agreement.

Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to incidents or accidents resulting in personal injury (including but not limited to sexual assault or harassment claims) that you allege occurred in connection with your use of the Services, whether before or after the date you agreed to the Medical Service Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state in which the incident or accident occurred.
