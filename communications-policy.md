We provide this Communications Policy, which governs the provision and delivery of text messages, email notifications, phone calls, and video calls by us and our communications service providers to you.

### 2.    Description of Communications Service

Clinic provides Communications to You and to other individuals who express interest in receiving information from and about our Service. These Communications may include information you request from us, to inform you of aspects of and updates to Services that may be of interest to you, updates of Services you are subscribed to, address, billing, and collection issues, account creation and access, and responses to your inquiries. We may also send Communications regarding various aspects of Your medical care, which may include, but shall not be limited to follow-up questions, test results, prescriptions, pharmacy information, shipping updates, appointments, patient satisfaction surveys, promotions and other general activity related to your Clinic account activity. Telemedicine Service Providers may also contact You directly via Phone if they feel a medical issue necessitates it. These numbers may be unlisted or unrecognized to you.

You understand that email, text messaging, and some forms of video calls are not confidential methods of communication and may be insecure. You further understand that, because of this, there is a risk that these electronic communications— some of which may contain information about your medical condition and care—might be intercepted and read by a third party. Password-protecting mobile device(s) and enabling encryption, if available, is recommended.

The use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) in email, text messaging, and some forms of video calls may be governed by additional privacy notices, including Clinic’s [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Pharmr/legal/blob/main/privacy-policy.md).
